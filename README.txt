This package has the below parts: 

1. the summarized csv files (under the directory ./summarized_excels) of each home with two seasons (summer and winter). 
Each home has four features: 
wd_ (window door opening area)
temp (temperature)
activity_level (overall activity in each room)
duration (duration of each labelled activity)

Note: in the package, all the time is local time. 

2. the scripts are under the directory ./python/. 
There is a README.txt as a guidance to run the code. 

3. floor maps (both smart home and IAQ teams) can be found under the directory ./floor_maps.
